# Lovenotes - MongoDB Hackathon Submission

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
designed using the effluent [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) and powered by [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com).

This project is my entry for the MongoDB hackathon.
It's a fairly simple idea i came up with while thinking of the day of love coming up soon #Feb14 :D.

This project allows for lovers to openly declare their affections for and to each other.
It uses MongoDB Atlas to save the data and mongodb native drivers to read the data.

- This is a React app project hosted on [Vercel](vercel.app)
- This project was designed using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)
- This project was created with create react app
